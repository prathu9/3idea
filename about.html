                    <p>
                        3D printing is a technology that is developing and growing faster than most other technologies due to the way it can influence manufacturing processes and help businesses perform to a higher level. A production line that is set up for 3D printing is easier to alter than that of a production line for traditional manufacturing, making 3D printing a feasible option for many reasons.
                    </p>
                    <h2>BENEFITS OF 3D PRINTING IN MANUFACTURING</h2>
                    <p>
                        The whole production line can be adjusted and adapted with the speed of the printing production line. Therefore, improvements to machinery, adjustments to the print speed or even a change of product can be made almost instantly. When you consider this against older methods, it can take several weeks or months to make the changes and then begin producing again.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Reduction in costs</h3>
                            <p>
                                Traditional manufacturing methods are notoriously expensive, whereas the 3D printing process makes the creation of parts products cheaper and more accessible. Unlike traditional manufacturing where many different people may be required to operate a number of machines or a production line is required to piece together the product, 3D printing removes this. Each 3D printer will require an operator to start the machine before it begins an automated process of creating the uploaded design. Therefore, when using 3D printing for manufacturing, the labour costs are significantly lower as there is no need for skilled machinists or operators to form part of the process.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                When businesses have the ability to confirm a design before committing it to production, it can help to remove the risk of errors, wasted materials and money. Creating products with 3D printing can help to increase confidence, especially when you consider that a 3D prototype is easier to redesign and alter than anything that has been created using a traditional method.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                3D printers will not need to be retooled between production runs. The speed at which a 3D printer can assemble could be deemed to be slower than that of a traditional assembly line. However, when you factor in machinery problems that can stop production and human error, there is more that can go wrong with traditional manufacturing.

                        </li>

                                3D printing makes it possible to develop ideas at a faster pace. In some instances, it could be possible for 3D concepts to be designed and printed on the same day but in terms of large-scale manufacturing, it is certainly faster than conventional methods. This can help companies to reduce manufacturing time from months to days while ensuring that they remain ahead of their competitors.

                        3Idea has successfully delivered 3D Printed Ashoka Emblem to Western Indian Railway. This 3D printed model was used as wall mount in luxury trains specially run for ministers and VVIP’s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Indian Western railway workshop personal Mr. Nitin Mayekar visited our facility and explained his requirement. They were using traditional method of die casting to produce metallic models but due to products high weight and cost, they wanted to explore 3D printing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They came up with ceramic mold of the Ashoka emblem and asked us to 3D scan and re-produce or reverse engineer using 3D scanning methodology. We suggested them 3D modeling as an alternative because it can provide better resolution to 3D printed output. They wanted to cost efficient method hence opted for 3D modeling.

                    <h2>3D PRINTING IN ARCHITECTURE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Architects, Engineers, and Construction (AEC) professionals understand the paramount importance of accurate and tangible scale models. It helps them and their clients visualize ideas realistically and vividly. Traditional ways of designing and assembling scale-models are tedious, costly, and rely heavily on handful skilled craftsmen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3D printing is set to revolutionise the way architects explore designs and innovate. 3D printing for architects empowers them easily create complex, accurate and durable scale models quickly and cost-effectively. Magnificent 3D printed architectural scale models can help architects impress their clients create and seize more opportunities. All of this can be done in-house, in a matter of clicks.
                    </p>
                    <h2>BENEFITS OF 3D PRINTING IN ARCHITECTURE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many leading scale model makers as well architectural firms have already reaped the benefits of 3D printing in architecture. 3D printed architectural scale models effectively convey the final appearance of design making design tangible leaving a lasting visual impression. 3D printing for architects offers the following advantages.

                        <li>
                            <h3>Saves Time and Money</h3>
                            <p>
                                One of the major benefits of 3D printing for architects is time-saving and cost-effectiveness. Unlike the traditional ways, 3D printed architectural scale models can be developed in matter of hours. Conventional methods require many days, many man-hours and skilled craftsmen, thus adding to the cost.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Seamless Integration</h3>
                            <p>
                                Most architectural firms already have in-house design teams using CAD applications. 3D printer can easily communicate with these applications to render scale models accurately, without introducing human-errors, thereby integrating seamlessly in the design process.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Added Design Possibilities</h3>
                            <p>
                                3D printers allow architects to design freely without worrying about human-errors being introduced in the final output. 3d printed architectural scale models are immaculately accurate. This freedom empowers architects to push the boundaries of design while having the possibility of rendering multiple-copies faster than ever.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Better Perspective</h3>
                            <p>
                                No amount of drawings, blueprints, or digital 3D models can emulate the “real-life” perspective offered by 3D printed architectural scale models. Architects can identify, test and assess the scale-model for design flaws taking correctional measures before construction. These visually appealing scale models can also be leveraged in promotions and presentations to clients.
                            </p>

                    <h2>CASE STUDY ARCHITECTURE</h2>
                    <p>
                        Skyline Architects specializes in designing and developing the best structures. It is primarily an Architectural Firm. They are best in their work and have set of clients and building more and more. They have their own designing facility and dealing in industrial products such as interior designing, plans and layouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They had gotten a project to design a Police Headquarter. They were always making models of their structures through the manual labor with materials such as thermocol, cardboard, plaster of paris, ceramic, etc. They had not moved into any new technology yet because they were unaware of it. Few of their structures were very complex to design it through manual labor hence finding it difficult to finish the task in hand in time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We approached and connected with them. Our first task was to educated and introduce them to 3D Printing technology, its products and the benefits. They understood this methodology of creating prototypes and structure modeling though 3D printing designing tools which earlier they found it difficult to manual do it were now very easy to create and recreate. Printing these designs though 3D Printers were very easy and faster with quality output. 3D Printing benefited them not only in time reduction but also turns out to be cost saving.
