                            contiguous United States. Items over five pounds shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico,
                            and other US Territories will be subject to a shipping charge which will be calculated at
                            checkout. *Items shipped via freight do not qualify for free shipping.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">We offer free in-store pickup in our Orange County, CA showroom by
                            appointment only. You can place your order online and select "in-store pickup" as your
                            shipping option, then book an appointment to pick up your order. Please note that orders
                            placed before 2 PM Pacific Time with in-store pickup selected will require a minimum of 2
                            hours before they can be collected; however, for ALL order pick-ups an in-store appointment
                            is required. If your order is placed after 2 PM, please schedule your pickup appointment for
                            any available time on the following business day. Our showroom hours are 10 AM - 5 PM,
                            Monday through Friday.</p>

                            pm Pacific Time it will ship the same day and, for U.S. orders, will normally take 2-3 days
                            to arrive. Large items that require freight shipment usually arrive within approximately
                            3-10 business days.</p>
